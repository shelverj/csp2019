<p>My name is Jacob Shelver. I'm a senior at Fargo North High School over in North Dakota.
 I'm here because my state is too small to offer any decent classes.
 I'm in tennis and FIRST Robotics as well as smaller things like Knowledge Bowl, Science 
Olympiad, and various clubs. I'd like to be an aerospace engineer and want to go to MIT 
if I don't do anything dumb. I enjoy watching Battlebots and combat robotics of all types,
 professional tennis (Ernests Gulbis is my favorite), and listening to historically accurate 
Eastern Scandanavian semi pagan symphonic power folk viking metal, as well as normal music. 
I feel like I would have more potential in life if I had an extra pair of thumbs.</p>
