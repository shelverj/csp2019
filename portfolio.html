<p> Here's my scratch project. It's based off of a game I play called Tagpro and I tried to
  take the basic elements of it and make a simple minefield thing except I'm bad and messed up the movement.
  Instructions are on-screen</p>
 <p> I don't know why the image isn't working but just click on that broken square thing you see when images don't work </p>

  <p> Week 7 scratch project. Pasting the description from the project because it's kind of hard to read: </p>
  <p> My tennis team plays our matches in a park a few blocks away from our school since the school courts are used for junior varsity
    because it's closer for middle schoolers. In the park, there's a somewhat run-down building affectionately known as the Sugar Shack.
    A couple years ago, during spring cleanup week, a senior found a couch on the side of the 
   road that just barely fit through the door. At every home meet, we now bring out the couch and cheer on our teammates from there. </p>

  <p> AppInventor project here. It's a duck hunter game in which you hunt the duck. Swipe the ball to shoot it at the duck. </p>

  <p> Python project: </p> 
  <p> https://repl.it/@JACOBSHELVER/interactivefiction </p>
<p> Was accidentally done using the wrong version of Python so some features may not work correctly. 
Also at one point it crashed when I was halfway through a block of code so I'm not sure if everything progresses 
  the way it should but hopefully it works
